\section{Explanation}

\subsection*{Reviewers are concerned with who in particular feels insecure about their property. Which groups feel insecure?} 

\par Table \ref{summary_stats_demo} shows means of all key outcomes across various demographic dummy variables. Security rights variables are in the bottom, in panel E. I have not yet done a regression analysis for these variables yet, however I believe the current table is still informative. Please let me know if you want to see this exact table, but with regression estimates instead. 

\subsection*{Reviewers are concerned about us dropping communities between Endline 1 and Endline 2. What was the process used to select which communities to drop?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Enumerators gave use a list of 68 communities (some of whom were treated) that they deemed difficult to reach.
    \item We ran a probit regression to predict, for each community, the probability of assigment to treatment. 
    \item Of the "difficult to reach" communities, of which 41 were eligible to be dropped, we dropped 20 and made a weight  for the rest that is 43/20
    \item Of the communities in the bottom 35\% of predicted probability of assignment to treatment, of which 41 were eligible to be dropped, we dropped 20 and make a weight for the rest that is 41/20. 
\end{enumerate}

What defines being eligible to be dropped? 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Being a control community
    \item Not being a control area in a in a larger community where another area in that community is treated (this is just one community). 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Do the weights affect our Endline 1 results at all?}

Table \ref{conflict_adj_p_dropped} answers this question. It shows two regressions. First, a regression with the Endline communities with Endline 2 weights. This means that the communities that were dropped are not in the regression, and communities that \textit{could have been dropped}, but weren't, are weighted more heavily. As you can see, all of our main effects hold. 

Second, it shows the effect of being a dropped community on all outcomes. There are no weights in this regression. As you can see, being a dropped is never a significant predictor of violence. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Note: I do not yet have a pretty table showing correlates of being dropped, but can make one if we still think it is necessary.} 
    \item \textit{Additional note: An earlier version of Table \ref{conflict_adj_p_dropped} where we had only the sample of non-dropped communities, but without additional weighting. I toyed with the idea of putting that regression in Table \ref{conflict_adj_p_dropped} as well, but decided there was enough information in the table already. Results are the exact same.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reviewers are concerned about how we handle multiple hypotheses. What are we doing to respond?}
In all of our ITT tables, we have corrected for multiple outcomes using the Westfall-Young method and the Sidak-Holmes method. In particular, we are using the \texttt{wyoung} package from \texttt{ssc} in Stata. The Westfall-Young approach involves constructing simulated p-values from bootstrapping (sampling with replacement). We came into this process under the impression that the Westfall-Young method would be less restrictive than the Holmes method, but this has not been the case. In all likelihood this is because out outcome measures are noisy. 

Tables \ref{land_conflict_paper_year} and \ref{all_conflict_paper_year} have a unique set of corrections, where we avoid correcting for the sub-components of indices. Table \ref{conflict_adj_p_year} shows adjusted results for land and general conflict in the same family. All other tables just have all outcomes in the table placed into the same family.
